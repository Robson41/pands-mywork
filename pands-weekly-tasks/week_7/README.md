Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
Think about what is being asked here, and document any assumptions you are making
The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. Need to research  how to do this.
Marks will be given for dealing with errors eg no argument, filename that does not exist, or is not a text file.
